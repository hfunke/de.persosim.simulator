/**
 * This class provides all data required to perform secure messaging according
 * to ISO7816-4.
 * 
 * This includes algorithms, keys, initialization data etc. The interface
 * provides is intended to be as general as possible in order to allow easy
 * sub-classing. As all required data is only provided via well defined getXxx()
 * methods overriding implementations can easily include any arbitrary
 * modification logic, such as including send sequence counters within the
 * initialization data for example.
 * 
 * Before a SmDataProvider is used/queried it shall be initialized by a call to
 * {@link #init()} with the previous data provider as parameter. This allows to
 * specify partial updates, as the new DataProvider can fetch the remaining data
 * from the previously used provider. Before processing an incoming or outgoing
 * APDU the methods {@link #nextIncoming()} and {@link #nextOutgoing()} are
 * called respectively. Beside these three methods no guarantees are made
 * regarding the calling order of the methods in this interface.
 * 
 * This interface extends {@link UpdatePropagation} so that instances can
 * directly be propagated through the processing data. {@link SecureMessaging}
 * layer checks and processes UpdatePropagations with this interface as key
 * right after processing the outgoing APDU. Therefore implementing classes
 * should provide this interface in their {@link #getKey()} method.

	 * It is intended to allow partial updates by providing an implementation
	 * that fetches missing values from the previously used provider.
	 * 
	 * As the previous provider is passed as parameter implementations may even
	 * choose to keep a reference to the predecessor and proxy calls to it. This
	 * may be needed when partial updating provider expects it's predecessor to
	 * not only provide static data but perform some calculation that the new
	 * provider is not capable or aware of. If such forwarding is implemented
	 * the prev provider does not know of this, therefore the class implementing
	 * this must provide the consistency granted by this interface to the
	 * encapsulated previous instance.

	 * the previous provider was null or did provide incompatible values) it
	 * shall throw a RuntimeException that can be handled by the calling layer.
